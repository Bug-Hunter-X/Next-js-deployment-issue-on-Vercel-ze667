# Next.js Deployment Issue on Vercel

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when deploying Next.js applications to Vercel.  The application works perfectly locally but fails to render correctly after deployment.

## Problem Description

The Next.js app, a simple 'Hello, world!' example, fails to display the expected content on Vercel, showing a blank page or an error instead.

## Solution

The solution often lies in properly configuring the Next.js `output` setting in `next.config.js`.  The default settings may be incompatible with the Vercel environment.  Sometimes, using `exportPathMap` may also be necessary for pre-rendering.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server (locally it will work fine).
4. Deploy to Vercel (it will likely fail). 

## Additional Notes

* Verify your Vercel project settings.
* Ensure your codebase is optimized for deployment.
* Check Vercel logs for any errors.
